//! Traits and implementations for reading virtio-media commands from and writing responses to
//! virtio descriptors.
//!
//! Virtio-media requires data send through virtqueues to be in little-endian order, but there is
//! no guarantee that the host also uses the same endianness. The [`VmediaType`] trait needs to be
//! implemented for all types transiting through virtio in order to ensure they are converted
//! from/to the correct representation if needed.
//!
//! Commands and responses can be read and written from any type implementing [`std::io::Read`] or
//! [`std::io::Write`] respectively. The [`ReadFromDescriptorChain`] and [`WriteToDescriptorChain`]
//! sealed extension traits are the only way to write or read data from virtio descriptors. They
//! ensure that transiting data is always in little-endian representation by using [`VmediaType`]
//! to wrap it into [`LeWrapper`].
